Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
Do your little bit of good where you are; it's those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world.
Actions speak better than words
Be here now
Focusing on your breathing
Focus on what is around you at this time
Appreciate what you do have
Focus on what you can do right now
Make note of your triggers and see what you can do about them.
Remember: you’re human (and so is everyone else).
Talk it out (instead of keeping it bottled up).
Communicate as directly as you can.People can’t read your thoughts and you can’t read theirs
